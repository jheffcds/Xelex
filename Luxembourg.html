            <h4>
                For the first three months of their stay, workers from the European Union (EU) and the
                European Economic Area (EEA) do not require permits or visas to work in Luxembourg.
                Individuals, who are non-citizens of the EU and the EEA, will have to apply for the right visa
                and work permit if they want to move to the country. Those who are not EU citizens may be
                eligible for an EU Blue Card, which would allow them to travel to and work in Luxembourg. <br><br>
                Eligibility requirements for a visa are determined by the duration of stay and the applicant's
                country of origin. <br> <br>
                Foreign nationals from countries that require a visa to enter Luxembourg must apply for a work
                visa. <br> <br>
                EU nationals planning to stay for up to three months need to present a national identity card or
                passport. Those wishing to remain or work longer than 90 days must follow specific
                procedures. <br> <br>
                Non-EU citizens, referred to as third-country nationals, who intend to work in Luxembourg for
                less than 90 days must obtain a work permit unless exempt. They can either apply for the permit
                themselves or have their employer file the application on their behalf.
                To qualify for a work permit, third-country nationals must possess a valid passport and a visa
                if their country of origin is on the visa-required list.
                Visas can be classified as either short-stay (Visa C) for up to 90 days or long-stay (Visa D) for
                more than 90 days. <br> <br>
                Procedure for Obtaining a Work Permit for Less Than 90 Days: <br>
                Employers must announce a job vacancy to the National Employment Agency (ADEM). <br>
                ADEM will assess whether a Luxembourger or EU citizen can fill the position. If not, the
                employer can proceed to establish an employment contract with the applicant and request a
                certificate for the employment rights. The employer must then inform the Ministry of Foreign
                and European Affairs about the employment agreement. <br>
                Visa applications should be submitted between six months and 15 days prior to the planned
                visit. Employees should send their work permit application to the Immigration Directorate of
                the Ministry of Foreign and European Affairs. <br><br>
                Applicants are required to:
            </h4> <br>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Provide identification and indicate their country of origin
                </li>
                <li>
                    Submit two recent passport-sized photos
                </li>
                <li>
                    Present a letter of invitation for the business trip
                </li>
                <li>
                    Show proof of financial means
                </li>
                <li>
                    Include a copy of their passport
                </li>
                <li>
                    Provide copies of their educational qualifications
                </li>
                <li>
                    Present a legally compliant employment contract
                </li>
                <li>
                    Submit the original certificate from ADEM
                </li>
                <li>
                    Have health insurance coverage for the duration of their stay
                </li>
                <li>
                    Provide power of attorney if applicable
                </li>
                <li>
                    ...
                </li>
            </ul> <br>
            <p>
                Typically, the Ministry of Foreign and European Affairs will respond within three months. If
                no response is received after that period, the application is assumed to be rejected. <br> <br>
                Procedure for Obtaining a Work Permit for Over 90 Days: <br><br>
                To acquire a long-stay work visa, employees must have a passport that does not expire within
                90 days of the visa's expiration date. Employers must declare a job vacancy to ADEM. <br>
                Applicants must first apply for a “temporary authorization to stay” with the Immigration
                Directorate of the Luxembourg Ministry of Foreign and European Affairs. Once this is granted,
                they can apply for a Type D long-stay visa. <br> <br>
                Salaried workers applying for a Type D visa must: <br>
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Hold a valid passport
                </li>
                <li>
                    Present the original ADEM certificate
                </li>
                <li>
                    Declare their arrival in their new commune in Luxembourg
                </li>
                <li>
                    Undergo a medical examination
                </li>
                <li>
                    Apply for a residence permit
                </li>
                <li>
                    ...
                </li>
            </ul> <br>
            <p>
                The employer must sign a dated employment contract and notify the Ministry of Foreign and
                European Affairs within three days of the employee's start date. <br> <br>
                Process for Employee Work Visa Sponsorship in Luxembourg <br> <br>
                For employees to work in Luxembourg, employers must complete the stated procedures, which
                include: <br>
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Declaring a job vacancy
                </li>
                <li>
                    Requesting a certificate that grants them the right to legally employ the applicant
                </li>
                <li>
                    Notifying government authorities of the commencement of the employment relationship
                </li>
            </ul> <br>
            <p>
                For long-stay visas, employers must also follow these steps, making sponsorship essential for visa approval. <br>
                The process for obtaining a Schengen visa for EU applicants in Luxembourg typically takes
                about 15 days, while the response time for a work visa application from a non-EU citizen is
                generally around 30 days. <br>
                Once all necessary work permits and visas are secured, the worker can relocate to Luxembourg
                to begin their employment.
