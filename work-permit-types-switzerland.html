                    This simplified process allows any EU/EFTA-
                    based company to assign their employees to work in Switzerland for a

                    The 4-month permit or 120 sporadic days permit typically allows for a fast-
                    track process, depending on the Swiss canton, which involves fewer formalities
                    and does not require registration in Switzerland.<br>For the 120 sporadic days
                    permit, all days spent in Switzerland are counted over a period of 12 months,
                    including weekends, public holidays, and vacations.
                    One drawback of the 4-month permit is that in most cantons, an extension is
                    not possible, and a “cooling-off” period of at least 12 months outside Swiss
                    territory is required. <br>
                    Meanwhile, a disadvantage of the 120 days permit is that
                    tracking the 120 days can be cumbersome, and only one 120-day permit can
                    be granted.</section>
