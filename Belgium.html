            <h4>
                With over 25 years of experience at Xelex, we offer comprehensive legal assistance
                concerning the employment and residence of foreign nationals in Belgium. Additionally, we
                can help you acquire the required permits for self-employment and support you in
                establishing a company based in Belgium. <br>
                Belgium is an attractive location for international business, partly due to its highly productive
                workforce. However, if you're looking to relocate employees or hire new staff from abroad,
                it's essential to ensure that all team members have the necessary visas and permits to work
                legally. <br>
                Nationals of the European Union or the European Economic Area (EEA) are exempted from
                holding a work permit to work on the Belgian territory. However, for stay longer than 90
                days these nationals need to register at the local municipality (gemeentehuis / maison
                communal) and obtain a residence permit. <br>
            <h3><u>Types of Work Visas in Belgium <br></u></h3>
                
                Belgium offers three categories of work permits for foreign nationals: <br>
            </h4> <br>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <b>Work Permit Type A</b>: To qualify for this permit, the applicant must have held a Type
                    B permit for four years during an unbroken ten-year period in Belgium. Type A
                    permits are valid indefinitely.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Work Permit Type B</b>: This permit allows foreign nationals to fill positions that
                    Belgian nationals cannot occupy. It is valid for one year and can be renewed.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Work Permit Type C</b>: This permit is granted to students and other temporary visitors
                    and is valid for a maximum of one year.
                </li>
            </ul> <br>
            <p>
                Type B is the most commonly issued work permit, and it is likely the one your employees
                will need. Along with a work permit, employees must obtain a residence visa to live in
                Belgium. <br>
                Requirements for Obtaining Belgian Work Visas <br>
                As Belgium is a member of the European Union (EU), nationals from other EU member
                states can work there without needing a work permit. Additionally, citizens from the
                European Economic Area (EEA) and Switzerland are exempt as well. However, other foreign
                nationals will require a work permit. <br><br>
                It is the employer's responsibility to secure a Type B work permit for foreign workers. <br><br>
                To obtain a visa, employees must provide the following documents (non-exhaustive list):
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    A valid passport, along with a copy of each page
                </li>
                <li>
                    Proof of accommodation in Belgium
                </li>
                <li>
                    Evidence of sufficient financial resources.
                </li>
                <li>
                    A police background check
                </li>
                <li>
                    A medical health certificate
                </li>
                <li>
                    A work permit
                </li>
            </ul> <br>
            <p>
                Application Process <br> <br>
                Foreign employees must secure both a work permit and a visa to live and work in Belgium.
                While it is the employer's responsibility to apply for the work permit, they must first
                demonstrate that there are no suitable job-seeking Belgian nationals available for the position.
                Once that is confirmed, the application process can proceed as follows: <br>
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    The employer submits a work permit application to the Belgian immigration authorities.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Upon approval of the work permit, the authorities send the work permit to the Belgian
                    Embassy in the prospective employee's home country.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The employee then visits the Belgian Embassy in their country to apply for a residence visa.
                </li>
                <li>
                    After receiving their visa and work permit, the employee may travel to Belgium.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Upon arrival in Belgium, the employee must register with the relevant authorities and
                    report their residential address.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The employee will then submit an application for an ID card.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Finally, the employee will collect their ID card and provide fingerprints.
                </li>
            </ol> <br>
            <p>After completing these steps, the employee can begin working for your company in Belgium</p>
